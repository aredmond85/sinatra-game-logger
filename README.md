# sinatra-game-logger
Sinatra Game Logger uses Active Record and Sinatra to pull together a basic content management app to catalog video games that you have in your collection, backlog, or want to buy.

## Installation

1) Install application by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2) Then execute: bundle install in your terminal

## Usage

Execute shotgun in the command line after cloning the repository.

## Running the tests

- Once you execute shotgun, it will provide an IP address and port to access as a URL. Copy and paste that full URL into your browser and start the app.
- You'll need to create a username and password first.
- Once you have created a username and password you can proceed to "Add a Game" and start your collection!
- After adding some entries it will put it out in to a simple table format for viewing.
- You can edit your entries, delete your enteries and log out when you no longer need to use it.
